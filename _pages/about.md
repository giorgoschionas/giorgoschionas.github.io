I am a 4th and final year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at University of Liverpool, where I am advised by [Piotr Krysta](https://sites.google.com/view/piotrkrysta) and [Georgios Birmpas](https://sites.google.com/site/gebirbas/home?authuser=0). My research interests span the intersection of Algorithmic Game Theory and Economics with emerging areas of computation, especially blockchains. I study blockchains and their applications, especially in decentralized finance. I previously graduated from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in Electrical and Computer Engineering, majoring in Computer Science, where I was advised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).
